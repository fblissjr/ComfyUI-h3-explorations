# Decisions and reversals

Written by hand. One dated line per decision the owner made, or per claim in
the prose that was corrected: what changed, what it used to say, where it
lives now, and the commit. Newest first. `CLAUDE.md` and `VISION.md` carry no
history notes; this page is where those go. Another document may also keep a
dated note in place, where a reader would otherwise trust the stale text.

Older history lives elsewhere and is not copied here:

- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md): every change, by version.
- [`docs/rules_history.md`](../rules_history.md): `CLAUDE.md` as it stood
  before the 2026-09-03 cut, frozen.
- [`docs/roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md): "Closed lanes", and the dated "Owner
  decisions" and forward-plan sections.
- `bench/results/`: the verdict records, each with its conditions.

## 2026-09-12

- **Audio-freeze lane opened** (owner): a known track frozen into the target
  audio rows with a per-stream mask, on the fl2va base first, the LTX pack's
  loop geometry on H3's grid after; reference audio parked until the loop
  runs because it regenerates the track. `docs/h3_audio_freeze.md` owns it.
  Before this, the mask path was known here only as something no shipped
  graph used (2026-08-30) and the looping packs were explicitly unread
  (`custom_node_gaps.md` section 8).

## 2026-09-11

- **The frontier table in `next_steps.md` counted a dense last step.** It said
  the leader runs five sage and eleven Sol of sixteen; since `07b903c` it runs
  four and twelve (reasoned, not rendered). A note above the table says so.
- **`docs/comfy_notes.md` said Sage runs `fp16 (most accurate)`, not `auto`.**
  The config has shipped `auto` since `497b421` (2026-08-18), which scoped the
  fp16 verdict to renders without Sol; the paragraph now says so.
- **The `shown red` column is gone from `docs/checks.md`** (owner). It
  recorded which checks had been shown failing under the retired
  red-before-green rule; git history has the cells.
- **`docs/prompting.md` 5.10 rewritten around the owner's point** (owner): too
  many words in a shot make the speaker rush. It carried a second word-budget
  formula beside §3.4's and blamed the rushed delivery on the Audio VAE; it now
  budgets from speaking time, points at §3.4, and claims no mechanism.
- **`CLAUDE.md` cut to what every session acts on** (owner). Seven "Settled
  about H3" facts, the numeric-input and capture-broadly rules, and the
  `coderef/` search advice moved to `docs/evidence.md`, `VISION.md` and
  [`references.md`](references.md); nothing was withdrawn. "A rendered clip
  cannot A/B a numerical change" stayed, because code and docs cite it as
  `CLAUDE.md`'s.
- **`bench/red/` removed** (owner). The red harnesses and their shared spine
  served only the retired red-before-green rule, and nothing imported or ran
  them; git history has them.
- **The `h3-experiment` skill removed** (owner). Its two steps nothing else
  held are in `docs/comfy_notes.md` "Adding a probe or an arm".
- **Documented commands run the ComfyUI venv's python** (owner). They said
  `uv run --active --no-sync python`; the venv's own interpreter is exactly
  what the server runs and involves no uv project step.
- **Run bench scripts with `python`, not `uv run`** (owner). `docs/eval_comparison.md`
  and the `h3-prompt` skill said `uv run python bench/...`; plain `uv run` in
  this repo builds a repo-local venv and, with `VIRTUAL_ENV` set, can recreate
  the ComfyUI one, as `docs/comfy_notes.md` records.
- **`CLAUDE.md` routes to the wiki instead of carrying its tables** (owner;
  CHANGELOG 0.99.72). The "What is where" tables moved into
  [`index.md`](index.md), which is now written by hand.
  `bench/build_wiki_index.py` used to generate that page from `CLAUDE.md`; it
  now only reports documents no link reaches.
- **History notes leave `CLAUDE.md`** (owner; CHANGELOG 0.99.72). Its rule
  "when you find prose that lost, correct it and say what it used to claim"
  now logs the old claim on this page.
- **"A perceptual claim needs a distribution of seeds judged blind, never a
  pair" is withdrawn** (owner; CHANGELOG 0.99.72) from `VISION.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, the `h3-experiment` skill, `docs/open_experiments.md` and
  [`prompting.md`](prompting.md), under the tinkering-repo rule.
  `docs/eval_comparison.md` still describes the blind process for when one
  is wanted.
- **Where the Sol-Attn kernel comes from.** `CLAUDE.md` said it was
  "installed from comfy-kitchen main". It is built from the owner's fork by
  `vendor/rebuild_kernel.sh`: the tag ComfyUI pins plus the `blk_cnt`
  commits, enforced since `d378479`.
- **The tinkering-repo rule** (owner). `CLAUDE.md` opens with it: not
  research-grade, rigour proportional to the claim, and a default that
  sglang and ComfyUI's own node or comfy-kitchen agree on is adopted without
  waiting on our evals.
- **No check has to be shown red before it is trusted** (owner, `48e1219`).
  `docs/checks.md` "The standard" says what it used to require.
- **Closed lanes moved into the repo** (`48e1219`). They were recorded only
  in agent memory; `docs/roadmap.md` "Closed lanes" is their home.
- **The probe canvas** (`48e1219`). The `h3-experiment` skill said to bench
  canvases cheaper than 16:9 by default; probes run at 1152x768 or 1344x768
  with 345 frames, the owner's rule of 2026-08-30.
- **Sol runs through the last step** (owner, `07b903c`). `end_percent` is 1.0
  on every graph, adopting sglang's and core's default. It used to stop short
  so the last step ran dense; the retired values are in the comments beside
  `workflows/h3_config.py::SOL_END_PERCENT_BY_STEPS` and `SOL_PDD_OVERRIDES`.
