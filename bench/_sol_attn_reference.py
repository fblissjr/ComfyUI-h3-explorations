"""Sol-Attn eager reference, vendored from kijai/comfy-kitchen.

Source: branch `sol_attn`, commit ad9a4a8, file
`comfy_kitchen/backends/eager/sol_attn.py`. Vendored rather than imported
because that branch is unmerged and ships no wheel -- the installed
comfy_kitchen (0.2.28) has no `sol_attn` at all.

DO NOT EDIT to fix a disagreement. The entire value of this file is that it
was written by the algorithm's author and not by us: if it and the Triton
kernel disagree, that is the finding. Re-vendor from upstream instead.

Two deletions from the original, both deliberate:

  - the `from ...registry import registry` import and the
    `@torch.library.custom_op("comfy_kitchen::sol_attn")` wrapper. Importing
    those here would register a `comfy_kitchen::sol_attn` op in the running
    process, which collides the moment a real wheel ships one.
  - `_accepts_max_blocks`, which only existed to feed that wrapper.

The pure function is otherwise byte-identical to upstream.

It is O(T^2) and materialises the full score tensor, so it refuses past
4 GiB -- it cannot run at H3's real sequence length. Small shapes only.
